- 👋 Hi, I’m @AtlantaScott
- 👀 I’m interested in learing more about neural amp modeler (NAM)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the command line interface (CLI) in NAM
- 💞️ I would like to use NAM to train using input and output wav files that can't be played through a device in a traditional sense.  
- 💞️ I have two audio files that are responding to the same source and I would like to make a model where the input file returns the output file.  
- 📫 How to reach me:  yoterhome@gmail.com
